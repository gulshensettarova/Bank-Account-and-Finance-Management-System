# Technical Specification: Bank Account and Financial Transactions Management System

## Project Objective
To develop a secure, modern system that allows bank users to create accounts, monitor balances, and perform financial transactions (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers) efficiently in a unified platform.

## General Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Java (using the Spring Boot framework)
- **Architecture**: Monolithic architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger or OpenAPI

## Core Modules

### 1. User and Authentication Module
- **User Registration**: Enables new users to sign up and log in.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin and user roles.
- **Authentication**: Secures login sessions with JWT.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)**: Adds an extra layer of security with SMS or Email verification.

### 2. Account Management Module
- **Account Creation**: Allows creation of new accounts (e.g., checking and savings accounts).
- **Account Details Viewing**: Displays account number, type, balance, and other details.
- **Transaction History**: Logs transaction history for each account and displays it to the user.

### 3. Financial Transactions Module
- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Enables users to deposit into and withdraw funds from their accounts.
- **Fund Transfers**:
  - **Internal Transfers**: Transfers between accounts within the same bank.
  - **External Transfers**: Transfers to accounts in other banks.
- **Balance Check**: Verifies sufficient funds before a transaction is initiated.

### 4. Fraud and Security Monitoring Module
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies and blocks suspicious transactions.
- **Security Alerts**: Sends alerts to users when suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, is detected.

### 5. Notification Module
- **Transaction Notifications**: Sends alerts to users via SMS or Email for key transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Security Alerts**: Notifies users of suspicious activity in real-time.

### 6. Admin Panel
- **User and Account Monitoring**: Allows administrators to review and manage user accounts and transactions, with options to block or deactivate accounts if needed.
- **Reports**: Generates statistics and reports on transaction history, balance summaries, and flagged suspicious activity.

## Technical Details
- **Monolithic Application**: All modules will be contained within a single Spring Boot application, simplifying deployment and management.

### Database Design
- **User Table**: Fields: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `password`, `role`.
- **Account Table**: Fields: `account_id`, `user_id`, `account_type`, `balance`, `created_at`.
- **Transaction Table**: Fields: `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `transaction_type`, `amount`, `transaction_date`.
- **Fraud Detection Table**: Fields: `fraud_id`, `transaction_id`, `risk_score`, `detected_at`.

### API Design and Sample Operations
- **POST /api/accounts** - Creates a new account.
- **GET /api/accounts/{accountId}** - Retrieves account details.
- **POST /api/transactions/deposit** - Adds funds to an account.
- **POST /api/transactions/withdrawal** - Withdraws funds from an account.
- **POST /api/transactions/transfer** - Executes fund transfers.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Manages authentication tokens for secure API access.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates permissions for users and admins.

### Security Measures
- **TLS Encryption**: Ensures HTTPS API interactions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits repeated requests to prevent abuse.
- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**: Detects and flags anomalies.

### Performance Optimization
- **Database Indexing**: Adds indexes on frequently queried fields, such as `transaction_date`.
- **Batch Processing**: Groups multiple notifications to reduce API and database load.
